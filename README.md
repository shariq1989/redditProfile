# redditProfile
A script that takes in a Reddit username and returns a list of subreddits where the user has posted, along with a list of subreddits where the user has commented. 

This helps me learn more about a user (AKA profile them) at a quick glance.

Running Instructions:
Start the web app
cd ..\redditProfile\profiler-app
ng serve

Start the server
cd ..\redditProfile\dataFetcher
python app.py
